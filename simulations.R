#script for creating simulated data under a variety of parameters
#and then determining if RSdetector function correctly determines these parameters

#to-do list from lab meeting

#create simulations to test robustness of picking up regime shifts at different break point spacings
#Create simulations to test robustness of picking up regime shifts of different sizes
#create simulations to test robustness of picking up regime shifts in different noise scenarios
