# The Monarch Regime project

this is the repo where I'll be developing the analysis to detect regime shifts in monarch butterfly time series at a variety of observation points. But for now, I'm mostly giggling at the name of the repo.

*by regime, I mean the set of dynamic rules, or constants, in an equation describing how populations of an organism change throught time. I am not referring to authoritarian government and/or the rules imposed by them. Nature (and the things people do to nature) is the government of butterflies.*
